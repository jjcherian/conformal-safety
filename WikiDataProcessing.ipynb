It was used by both patrician and plebeian families, and gave rise to the patronymic \"gens Servilia\". The feminine form is \"Servia\". The name was regularly abbreviated Ser. Servius was never one of the most common praenomina; about ten other names were used more frequently. Most families did not use it, although it was a favorite of the Cornelii and the Sulpicii, two of the greatest patrician houses at Rome. The name gradually became less common towards the end of the Republic, but was still used in imperial times.</s><s>Origin and meaning of the name. The original meaning of Servius was forgotten by the late Republic. Chase derives the name from the verb \"servo\", \"to keep\" or \"preserve\". This seems consistent with other Latin praenomina, such as \"Sertor\", which appears to have a similar meaning. Varro had nothing to say about the name, although the epitome, \"De Praenominibus\" (\"Concerning####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Praenomina\") by Julius Paris, suggests that it was given to a child whose mother died in childbirth. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, apparently followed by Festus, indicated that it was given to a child whose mother was held in bondage. This etymology was based on the similarity between \"Servius\" and \"servus\", a slave, and although it is certainly an example of false etymology, the association of these words is probably the main reason that Servius was not more common.</s>')\n",

In that year the Ukrainian Government partially limited freedom of the press through tax inspections (Mykola Azarov, who later became Prime Minister of Ukraine, headed the tax authority during Kuchma\\'s presidency), libel cases, subsidization, and intimidation of journalists; this caused many journalists to practice self-censorship. In 2003 and 2004 authorities interfered with the media by issuing written and oral instructions about what events to cover.

Since Viktor Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine in February 2010 Ukrainian journalists and international journalistic watchdogs (including the European Federation of Journalists and Reporters Without Borders) have complained about a deterioration of press freedom in Ukraine. Yanukovych responded (in May 2010) that he \"deeply values press freedom\" and that \"free, independent media that must ensure society\\'s unimpeded access to information\". Anonymous journalists stated early May 2010 that they were voluntarily tailoring their coverage so as not to####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### offend the Yanukovych administration and the Azarov Government. The Azarov Government denies censoring the media, so did the Presidential Administration and President Yanukovych himself. Presidential Administration Deputy Head Hanna Herman stated on 13 May 2010 that the opposition benefited from discussions about the freedom of the press in Ukraine and also suggested that the recent reaction of foreign journalists organizations had been provoked by the opposition. On 12 May 2010, the parliamentary committee for freedom of speech and information called on the General Prosecutor\\'s Office to immediately investigate complaints by journalists of pressure on journalists and censorship. Also in May 2010 the Stop Censorship movement was founded by more than 500 journalist. A law on strengthening the protection of the ownership of mass media offices, publishing houses, bookshops and distributors, as well as creative unions was passed by the Ukrainian Parliament on 20 May 2010. Since the February 2010 election of Viktor Yanukovych as President Media watchdogs have stated attacks and pressure on journalists have increased. The International Press Institute addressed an open letter to President Yanukovych on 10 August 2010 urging him to address what the organisation saw as a disturbing deterioration in press freedom over the previous six months in Ukraine.

Media at times demonstrated a tendency toward self‑censorship on matters that the government deemed sensitive. Stories in the electronic and printed media (veiled advertisements and positive coverage presented as news) and participation in a television talk show can be bought. Media watchdog groups have express concern over the extremely high monetary damages that were demanded in court cases concerning libel. In 2013 there were concerns over the corrupting influence of certain political figures, connected to the government of Viktor Yanukovych on Ukrainian media.</s><s>History.:Euromaidan revolution and Poroshenko presidency (2014). A May 2014 report from the OSCE found approximately 300 instances of perceived violent attacks on the media in Ukraine since November 2013. The Ukrainian NGO Institute of Mass Information recorded at least 995 violations of free speech in 2014 - the double than in 2013 (496) and triple than in 2012 (324). Most attacks on journalists####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### happened during the euromaidan period in Kyiv (82 in January, 70 in February 2014). 78 journalists were abducted and illegally detained by various groups in 2014 - a new category of professional risk; 20 such cases happened in Donetsk in April 2014. In 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the \"Glavnoe\", \"Gordon\" and UNIAN websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel \"112 Ukraine\". Political interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of Yanukovych from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers. The 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election was covered with a wide variety of political orientations in the media. Minor cases of pressures or censorship attempts were reported in 2014 too. In Kirovohrad in December 2014 a regional politician ordered a subordinate to review the \"Zorya\" newspaper before its publication. Censorship issues were debated in 2015 concerning aggressive propaganda from Russian state-owned news outlets to support the Russian annexation of Crimea,####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### encourage separatism in Donbas and discredit the Kyiv government. Creating some concern among Western human rights monitors was that under the impact of war and perceived extreme social polarization the Ukrainian government has been accused of cracking down on pro-separatist points of view. For example, Ukraine also shut down most Russia-based television stations on the grounds that they purvey \"propaganda,\" and barred a growing list of Russian journalists from entering the country. The Ministry of Information Policy was established on 2 December 2014. The ministry oversees information policy in Ukraine. According to the first Minister of Information, Yuriy Stets, one of the goals of its formation was to counteract \"Russian information aggression\" amidst pro-Russian unrest across Ukraine, and the ongoing war in the Donbas region. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that the main function of the ministry is to stop \"the spreading of biased information about Ukraine\". On 16 May 2017 president Poroshenko signed a decree banning various Russian internet service providers and news sources, among others, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Yandex,\\xa0Rossiya Segodnya, RBC, VGTRK, but also a number of independent stations such as the RBC, claiming this was done for \"security reasons####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\". Tanya Cooper from Human Rights Watch called the decree: \"a cynical, politically expedient attack on the right to information affecting millions of Ukrainians, and their personal and professional lives\". Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also condemned the ban imposed on Russian social networks. Since November 2015 Ukrainian authorities, state agencies and local government authorities are forbidden to act as founders (or cofounders) of printed media outlets. Freedom House reported the status of press freedom in Ukraine in 2015 as improving from Not Free to Partly Free. It justified the change as follows: due to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych\\'s government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator. In 2015 the main concerns about media freedom in Ukraine concern the handling of pro-Russian propaganda, the concentration of media ownership, and the high risks of violence against journalists, especially in the conflict areas in the east. In September 2015 Freedom House classified the Internet in Ukraine####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### as \"partly free\" and the press as \"partly free\". Ukraine was in 102nd place out of 180 countries listed in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index.

Beevor strongly criticized the ban and said the source was actually German resistance fighter Helmuth Groscurth. \"It\\'s utterly outrageous. They have no reason for doing it.

In its \"Freedom on the Net\" report covering the period May 2012 through April 2013, Freedom House found the Internet in Ukraine to be \"largely unhindered\" and rated the Internet in Ukraine as \"Free\" with an overall score of 28 on a scale from 0 (most free) to 100 (least free). The report said that \"there is no practice of institutionalized blocking or filtering, or a regulatory framework for censorship of content online\", but \"there have been attempts at creating legislation which could censor or limit content\" and would \"present indirect threats to freedom of information online.\" As of 2012, access to Internet content in Ukraine was largely unfettered. Ukraine possessed relatively liberal legislation governing the Internet and access to information. While there were no government restrictions on access to the Internet, law enforcement bodies were known to monitor the Internet, at times without appropriate legal authority. There have been occasional agitations of interference by law enforcement agencies with prominent bloggers and online publications. In 2014 it was reported that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) asked the Ukrainian Internet Association (UIA) to block a list of websites accused of \"promote war, ethnic hatred, and violent change in the constitutional order or####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### territorial integrity of Ukraine.\" Such orders should, however, come from courts of law and not security agencies. On 16 May 2017, President Poroshenko signed a decree requiring providers to block access to a number of Russian websites including four of the most popular websites in Ukraine: VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Yandex and Mail.Ru. The president claimed they participated in an information war against Ukraine.</s><s>Situation in the Russian-annexed Crimea. The media environment in Crimea was completely transformed by the March 2014 Russian annexation of the peninsula, after the ejection of Viktor Yanukovych from power in Ukraine following the euromaidan protests. Russian authorities engineered an annexation referendum to Russia, and restrictive Russian media laws started to be enacted in the Black Sea peninsula too. Media conditions in Crimea in 2014 were worse than in Russia itself, due to the effort of Russia-imposed authorities to rein in a previously relatively pluralistic media landscape. Media outlets were shut down, broadcasts of Ukrainian channels were suspended, and journalists fled the region due to fears of harassment, violence, and arrests. The situation of press freedom in Crimea in 2014 was identified by Freedom House as the worst in the European continent. Russian outlets, particularly state-owned ones, enjoy a####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### dominant position in post-annexation Crimea. The distribution of Ukrainian print media has been obstructed by Russian officials, and even the Ukrainian Postal Agency had to stop deliveries in the peninsula. Widespread and irregular expropriations by Russian authorities have also affected the Crimean media landscape Free access to the internet in Crimea was threatened by Russian authorities. Rostelecom laid a cable under the Kerch strait and provided online services in the peninsula starting from July 2014. Since August 2014, mobile phone services by Ukrainian carriers were disrupted and replaced by Russian companies.</s><s>Situation in the Russian-annexed Crimea.:Legal framework. After the annexation, Russian authorities passed a local constitution on the Russian model and started imposing Russian legislation. Despite guarantees for freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the Russian legislation, politicised judiciary and restrictive laws devoid them of actual contents, leaving broad discretion to federal regulators in media registration and licensing. All media in Crimea, including online ones, were afforded until January 2015 to register with the Russian federal media regulator Rozkomnadzor and get a license. Officials warned editors that registration would be denied to media that spread \"extremist\" contents. A December 2013 Russian law against separatism (carrying sanctions of up to 5 years####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### in prison) was used to repress criticism of the annexation and calls for a return of the territory to Ukraine. NGOs, journalists\\' associations and citizen groups in Crimea became subject to restrictive Russian laws, including measures limiting foreign funding. Russian authorities failed to protect journalists, activists and citizens from abuses by paramilitaries and security forces. Cases of unlawful detentions and physical assaults were reported throughout 2014 in Crimea.</s><s>Situation in the Russian-annexed Crimea.:Attacks and threats against journalists. Since the annexation, Russian authorities threatened and harassed pro-Ukrainian or simply independent media in Crimea.

In September 2014 the premises of the \"Avdet\" newspaper were raided and searched by unidentified security forces, without a warrant. The newspaper was closed down and its bank accounts seized. Kaybullayev was officially warned that he would be prosecuted and risked up to 5 years in jail if \"Avdet\" had continued reporting on calls for a boycott of the 2014 Crimean legislative election. - The Crimean Tatar TV channel ATR received a warning in May 2015 after covering a Tatar protest. It was subject to an inspection in September 2014 by the Interior Ministry, as suspect of inciting \"extremism\" and \"distrust towards the authorities\". KGB agents regularly called the station and applied pressures, threatening it with closure.</s><s>Situation in the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Seven journalists and media workers were killed in Ukraine in 2014. One of them, Vyacheslav Veremiy of \"Vesti\", was shot in Kyiv in February 2014. The others died in the conflict areas in the east. (According to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine\\'s Office, Veremiy\\'s murderer was####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### Jalal Aliyev. Who, according to unofficial information, was killed in Horlivka in July 2015 fighting for the Donetsk People\\'s Republic.) In Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian-backed separatists seized control of broadcasting infrastructure, replacing Ukrainian channels with Russian pro-Kremlin channels in both on-air and cable transmissions. In July 2014, pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk tried to deter journalists from covering the downing of the MH17 airliner by threatening them with arbitrary detention and intimidation.</s><s>Transparency of media ownership. Transparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies. The lack of transparency on media ownership has typically been a negative trait of the Ukrainian media system. In 2005 Ukraine committed itself to the Council of Europe to introduce a law for ensuring transparency of media ownership, according to the Resolution 1466 (2005)1 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In 2014, the European Commission\\'s progress report on the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in Ukraine####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### found the lack of transparency as an issue in the country and that proper legislative framework should be adopted. To comply with its international commitment, legislation on transparency of media ownership has been reformed in 2015. On 10 September 2015, President Petro Poroshenko signed the law called \"On Amendments to Several Laws of Ukraine on Ensuring the Transparency of Media Ownership and Implementing the Principles of state Policy in the Sphere of Television and Radio Broadcasting\". The law entered into force on 1 October 2015. The new legal system regulating transparency of media ownership, which establishes a detailed system for guaranteeing transparency, has been appraised for its level of innovation by many international organisations and experts but still the effectiveness of its implementation remains to be seen. In general terms, the new regulation obliges broadcasts and program service providers to make public detailed information about their ownership structures and final beneficiaries. These requirements apply to the audiovisual sector (TV and radio), print and information agencies but not to online publications. Also, the amendments prevent businesses and individuals registered offshore from establishing and owning broadcast companies and program service providers in Ukraine. Moreover, the new law sets forth new financial disclosure rules for owners. Specifically, the new law amends article 12 of the existing Law of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting of 1994, establishing that####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### national and local government authorities, individuals and legal entities which are registered offline, political parties, religious organisations, professional unions, and persons that were convicted by courts and that are still serving their sentences cannot be owners of a TV or radio stations in Ukraine. Furthermore, the Law prohibits to physical or legal persons residing in a country which is recognised as an aggressor or occupier the right to own a television or a radio station in Ukraine. This sentence refers to the Russian Federation which annexed Crimea in 2014. The Law provides a new definition of ownership which is closely connected to the exercise of a decisive influence in the management or business activity of the media outlet directly or through other persons and includes also final beneficiaries. The Law requires that information on the ownership structure and on the individuals owning at least 10% or more of a television or radio broadcasting have to be made public on the company\\'s website and sent to the National Council for Questions of Television and Radio Broadcasting, which is the national media regulator in Ukraine. According to the law, the council can impose fines when information provided are insufficient or incorrect. According to some experts, one of the main weakness of the new law is that it does not exclude funding from financial sources located in Cyprus (even if it prohibits the transfer of funds from offshore territories####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####), through which ownership of most Ukrainian TV channels is exercised. Among some commentators there are some doubts that the Law will be amended to address this issue, due to the strong lobbying efforts of TV owners. Other doubts have been voiced due to the lack of an effective sanctions system. In 2016, Reporters Without Borders, together with the Institute of Mass Information (Kyiv), launched the project Media Ownership Monitor Ukraine to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Ukraine, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets, and detailing also the interests and the affilitations of owners into companies or political parties.</s><s>See also. - Human rights in Ukraine - Internet censorship and surveillance in Ukraine - List of newspapers in Ukraine - Media of Ukraine - Telecommunications in Ukraine - Television in Ukraine</s>')\n",

      "('Athinkhaya', '<s>Athinkhaya Athinkhaya (, ; also spelled Athinhkaya; 1261 – 1310) was a co-founder of Myinsaing Kingdom in present-day Central Burma (Myanmar). As a senior commander in the Royal Army of the Pagan Empire, he, along with his two younger brothers Yazathingyan and Thihathu, led Pagan\\'s successful defense of central Burma against the Mongol invasions in 1287. Following the collapse of the Pagan Empire, the brothers became rivals of King Kyawswa of Pagan in central Burma, and overthrew him in December 1297, nine months after Kyawswa became a Mongol vassal. They successfully defended the second Mongol invasion (1300–01), and emerged the sole rulers of central Burma.</s><s>Early life. Athinkhaya was born 1261/62 to a prominent family in Myinsaing in Central Burma. His father Theinkha Bo was a younger brother of the \"sawbwa\" (chief) of Binnaka, and had fled to Myinsaing after a dispute with his brother in 1260. Traditional (British colonial era) scholarship identifies his father as an ethnic Shan. But the historian Michael Aung-Th####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####win has rejected the assertion, given that no historical evidence any kind exists to support the claim. At any rate, Theinkha Bo married a daughter of a wealthy banker at Myinsaing. Athinkhaya was the eldest of the couple\\'s four children. He had two younger brothers Yazathingyan and Thihathu, and a younger sister Hla Myat.</s><s>Royal service. Athinkhaya entered the royal service of King Narathihapate, and was later joined by his two brothers. The three brothers distinguished themselves in the war with the Mongols, which began in 1277. Athinkhaya married into the royal family, marrying Princess Saw U, a niece of the king and a granddaughter of King Uzana and Queen Thonlula. (His sister Hla Myat also married to Prince Thihathu, Viceroy of Prome.) In 1285, the three brothers, still in their twenties, came to lead the defense of Central Burma. The army had been defeated in northern Burma by the Mongols in the previous dry-seasons (1283–85). Over the next two years, they manned the front (north of present-day Mandalay) while the king and his court relocated####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### to Lower Burma. It was probably during this period that the brothers were given the official titles of Athinkhaya, Yazathingyan and Thihathu by which they would be known in history. The king later accepted the Mongol suzerainty in January 1287 but was assassinated on 1 July 1287. When the Mongols at Tagaung invaded southward, the brothers successfully held the Mongols, who after taking heavy casualties retreated to their base in Tagaung.</s><s>Rise to power in Central Burma.</s><s>Rise to power in Central Burma.:Viceroy of Myinsaing. The country fell into anarchy. The Mongols at Tagaung decided not to get involved, leaving the power vacuum unfilled. In Central Burma, the brothers officially took over the leadership of the army, and consolidated their hold of the Kyaukese region, the main granary of the Pagan Kingdom. One of Narathihapate\\'s sons Kyawswa eventually emerged king at Pagan on 30 May 1289 but Kyawswa did not control much beyond the capital. The real power in Central Burma now belonged to the brothers. On 19 February 1293, Kyawswa tried to buy their loyalty by appointing them v####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####iceroys of Kyuakse: Athinkhaya as viceroy of Myinsaing, Yazathingyan as viceroy of Mekkhaya and Thihathu as viceroy of Pinle. The territories they were given to govern were small but the king himself ruled a small region around the capital. The brothers took the title of viceroy but did not think much of the \"king\". Their commemorative inscription of their appointment as viceroy actually states that they were equal to the king, and reminds that it was them who defeated the Mongols in 1287. When Martaban (Mottama) in Lower Burma, which had been in revolt since 1285 and officially declared independence from Pagan since 1287, became a vassal of Sukhothai in 1293, it was the brothers who marched to retake the former Pagan territory. Although they were driven back by 1296, it left no doubt as to who held the real power in Central Burma.</s><s>Rise to power in Central Burma.:Overthrow of Kyawswa. In the following years, the brothers continued to consolidate power in Central Burma. Their youngest brother Thihathu was the least diplomatic, proclaiming himself \"hsinbyushin####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####\" (ဆင်ဖြူရှင်, \"Lord of White Elephant\") in 1295 and \"mingyi\" (မင်းကြီး, \"Great King\") in 1296. Though Athinkhaya and Yazathingyan may have tolerated their brother\\'s declarations, Kyawswa felt threatened by them. In January 1297, Kyawswa decided to ask for the protection of the Mongols, and was recognized by the Mongol emperor Temür Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March 1297. The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of Kyawswa. The brothers ultimately decided to overthrow Kyawswa and face the Mongols. On 17 December 1297, with the help of the dowager queen Pwa Saw, they overthrew Kyawswa, and installed one of Kyawswa\\'s sons, Saw Hnit as their puppet king. The brothers now ruled Central Burma as co-regents from their respective capitals of Myinsaing, Mekkhaya and Pinle.</s><s>Co####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR####-regency.</s><s>Co-regency.:Second Mongol invasion. After the overthrow, the brothers braced for a reprisal by the Mongols. But the expected reprisal never came. They became bolder, and allowed Saw Hnit to give his first audience on 8 May 1299. Two days later, they executed Kyawswa and his eldest son Theingapati. Another son of Kyawswa, Kumara Kassapa, escaped to Yunnan in September 1299 to seek the help of the Mongols. In January 1300, the brothers decided to force the issue by attacking and occupying southernmost Mongol garrisons at Singu and Male. The Mongol government at Yunnan could not respond until a year later, sending a 12,000-strong army. The brothers decided to face the Mongols in Central Burma at their heavily fortified city of Myinsaing. The Mongol army began the siege of Myinsaing on 25 January 1301, and launched a major attack on the fort on 28 February 1301. The attack failed. On 12 March 1301, Athinkhaya, with his brothers\\' support, made an offer to the Mongol command, to give them a bribe in exchange for their withdrawal. The Mongol command####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### agreed. On 6 April 1301, upon receiving a bribe of 800 taels (30\\xa0kg) of gold and 2200 taels (83\\xa0kg) of silver, the Mongol army began their withdrawal. The Yunnan government did not agree with the withdrawal; the two senior Mongol commanders were executed for abandoning the original mission. Nonetheless, the Mongols did not send another expedition, and withdrew altogether from northern Burma two years later.</s><s>Co-regency.:Post-invasion. The Mongols left northern Burma to their nominal vassals, the Shan states. The brothers were able to extend their influence as far north as Tagaung but no further. The brothers\\' joint-rule survived despite Thihathu\\'s ambitions. The youngest brother assumed a royal title of Ananda Thiha Thura Zeya Dewa in 1306, and proclaimed himself king on 20 October 1309. It is not known what the two elder brothers made of the proclamations. At any rate, Athinkhaya died on 13 April 1310 and the two younger brothers were still alive. Yazathingyan passed to the background and died in 1312/13. Thihathu proclaimed himself as the successor of the Pagan dynasty, as he####SPECIAL####SEPARATOR#### founded Pinya Kingdom on 7 February 1313.</s><s>Bibliography. - - - - - - - - - - -</s>')\n"
