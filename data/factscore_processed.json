After completing his medical studies, he worked as an assistant to the famous obstetrician Franz Carl Naegele in Heidelberg. In 1894, he became a lecturer in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Berlin, and in 1906, he was appointed as a full professor.\n\nBraun is credited with many significant contributions to the field of obstetrics, including the development of a new method for measuring the size of the pelvis, which is still used today. He also invented a device called the \"Braun-Stadler apparatus,\" which allowed for accurate measurement of fetal heart rate during labor. Additionally, he was the first to describe a condition called \"Braun-Fernwald syndrome,\" which is a rare disorder that affects pregnant women.\n\nBraun was a prolific writer and published numerous articles and books on obstetrics and gynecology. He was also a respected teacher and trained many students who went on to become prominent obstetricians themselves.
