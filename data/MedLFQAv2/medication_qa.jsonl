During this process, one event triggers another, which triggers another, and so on, to keep your blood sugar levels balanced.How insulin works\nDuring digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin.The insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen. Your body uses glycogen for fuel between meals.||How glucagon works\nGlucagon works to counterbalance the actions of insulin.About four to six hours after you eat, the glucose levels in your blood decrease, triggering your pancreas to produce glucagon. This hormone signals your liver and muscle cells to change the stored glycogen back into glucose.

{"Question": "what antidepressants are best for someone with a heart arrhythmia", "Free_form_answer": "A research team at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital has verified that several antidepressants may increase the risk of a potentially dangerous heart rhythm disturbance (arrhythmia). By examining the electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 38,000 people taking 11 different antidepressants, they confirmed that higher doses of citalopram (Celexa), amitriptyline (Elavil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) were associated with a slight disruption of the electrical function of the heart. This delay as seen on an ECG is known as a prolonged Q-T interval, and it is a risk factor for an arrhythmia that causes sudden death. Although the majority of people with this ECG abnormality never develop an arrhythmia, the researchers cautioned that people taking these antidepressants should discuss the risk with their doctor. The researchers emphasized that no one with a history of arrhythmias should start taking these medications. Instead, such a patient might try one of the antidepressants that do not increase the Q-T interval: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), or buproprion (Wellbutrin).

{"Question": "how do steroids effect the digestive system", "Free_form_answer": "teroid abuse can also be hepatotoxic, promoting disturbances such as biliary stasis, peliosis hepatis, and even hepatomas, which are all usually reversible upon discontinuation.Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, can have a significant impact on the digestive system. One of the main areas affected is the stomach. Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, and their prolonged use can lead to the development of gastric ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. They may also contribute to a delay in gastric emptying which leads to a feeling of bloating and discomfort.Another area where steroids can have an effect is the liver. Steroids are metabolized in the liver and can potentially cause damage to this organ. As a result of prolonged use, steroids can cause a condition called steroid-induced cholestasis. This is a condition where the flow of bile from the liver is slowed, leading to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure in serious cases.Furthermore, steroids can also affect nutrient absorption in the intestines. They can impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time.", "Must_have": ["Steroids can increase the production of stomach acid, potentially leading to the development of gastric ulcers, GERD, and gastritis.", "Steroid use can also cause steroid-induced cholestasis, a liver condition where the flow of bile is slowed.", "Steroids can also impair the absorption of calcium and vitamin D in the intestines, increasing the risk of bone loss and osteoporosis over time."], "Nice_to_have": ["Prolonged steroid use may cause a feeling of bloating and discomfort due to delayed gastric emptying.", "In serious cases, steroid-induced cholestasis can lead to itching, jaundice, and even liver failure."]}
